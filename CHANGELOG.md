# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security
- `js-yaml` 4.3.1 → 4.3.2 (GHSA-2883-xcg3-v3hh, used by `electron-updater`); the production dependencies have no known advisories again.

### Internal
- Repository prepared for public release: README restructured (badges, contents, design decisions, security model, tests), `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting.
- CI also runs `npm run lint`.

## v1.1.2 — 2026-09-16

Fixes for two keyless modules, and CI off the deprecated Node 20 runtime.

### Fixed
- `FLOW` never loaded data: Yahoo's crumb endpoint refuses `Accept: application/json` with HTTP 406, and every request asked for JSON. The crumb is now requested as plain text. This was hidden behind Yahoo's 429s, which turned out to target non-browser TLS fingerprints rather than IPs — the app itself (Electron) gets through. Live-verified in the running app.
- `WIRE` showed character codes instead of punctuation — MarketWatch headlines read "a &#x2018;rare win&#x2019;", and hovering a Reuters headline showed `&nbsp;&nbsp;` in the summary. Numeric character references now decode in every feed, and summaries decode their HTML entities after the tags are stripped.

### Internal
- GitHub Actions moved to their Node 24 majors (`checkout@v7`, `setup-node@v7`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `download-artifact@v8`), and CI builds and tests on Node 22 — Node 20 is end-of-life.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-09-16

Make it easy to start: downloadable installers, and a first run that works without any API key.

### Added
- Installers are now downloadable: tagging `v*` publishes a GitHub Release with the Windows, macOS and Linux installers attached, notes taken from `docs/RELEASE-<version>.md`.
- First run without a key: the welcome screen lists the functions that work with no API key (`WIRE`, `ECAL`, `SOCL`, `CRYP`, `FLOW`, `SPACE`, `FLT`) as one-click starts, and `HELP` tags them **NO KEY** (a new `keyless` flag in the function registry).
- README: *Install* and *First steps* sections for people who just want to use the app; the npm workflow moved to *Building from source*.

### Fixed
- "Skip for now" on the welcome screen is remembered — it no longer returns on every launch.
- Linux installers failed to build (electron-builder needs an author e-mail for the `.deb` maintainer field); `publish.owner` pointed at the wrong GitHub account.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-09-15

Seven keyless data modules ported from the `Riel-main` reference app, plus a
lint gate and coverage for logic that had none.

### Added
- `ECAL` — economic calendar: this week's macro events (CPI, NFP, FOMC, …) from the keyless Forex Factory JSON mirror, with impact (ALL/MED+/HIGH) and country (US/EU/GB/JP/ALL) filters, next-event highlight, 30 min disk cache with stale fallback.
- `INSD` — insider filings: live market-wide SEC Form 4 stream from the EDGAR "latest filings" Atom feed (reuses the EDGAR contact e-mail from SET → Providers), Issuer+Reporting pairs folded into one row, 2 min poll with new-row flash. First two modules ported from the `Riel-main` reference app.
- `WIRE` — keyless RSS news wire (Reuters via Google News, CNBC, Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, CoinDesk) with a finance sentiment lexicon per headline, a bull/bear/average meter in the header, category filters (ALL/MARKETS/CRYPTO) and a 2 min poll; one broken feed never blanks the wire. The same lexicon now backfills missing sentiment badges in `N`/`TOP` (provider-supplied scores are never overwritten). Third module ported from `Riel-main`.
- `SPACE` — space dashboard: live ISS position (wheretheiss.at) plotted on a new dependency-free dark SVG world map (Natural Earth outline, committed via `scripts/gen-worldmap.mjs`), NOAA geomagnetic Kp with storm colouring, locally computed moon phase with full/new countdowns, and The Space Devs launch schedule (30 min cache). Parts fail independently — the panel renders whatever is up.
- `FLT` — flight board: live continental-US airspace via anonymous OpenSky on the same SVG map, business-jet callsigns (NetJets, Flexjet, VistaJet, …) highlighted amber and sorted first, ALL/JETS filter, honest 10-minute poll sized to the anonymous credit budget. Fourth and fifth modules ported from `Riel-main`.
- `FLOW` — options flow: nearest-expiry chain from Yahoo's keyless endpoint (cookie + crumb handshake, crumb cached and refreshed once on rejection), put/call volume ratio with a call-vs-put split bar, the twelve busiest contracts with volume bars, and an UNUSUAL badge where volume outruns both open interest and a 100-contract floor. Ticker-driven (`AAPL FLOW`), `FLOW` alone reads SPY; 5 min disk cache doubles as the stale fallback. Sixth module ported from `Riel-main`. Yahoo throttles aggressively per IP — when it does, the panel shows an honest rate-limited state rather than stale-looking numbers.
- `SOCL` — social stream: Reddit hot posts from r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing and r/CryptoCurrency, scored with the same finance lexicon as `WIRE` and shown with a bull/bear meter, per-subreddit filters and the new-row flash. Recurring megathreads (daily discussion, what are your moves) are filtered out. Seventh module ported from `Riel-main`.
  Fetched as a single **multireddit** feed rather than one request per subreddit: anonymous Reddit RSS allows roughly one request per 60-second window per IP, and Reddit merges its own hot ranking across the subs while tagging each entry with its own `<category>`. The Atom parser now surfaces that category (unused by `INSD`/`WIRE`).

### Internal
- eslint flat config and `npm run lint`: the codebase carried 13 disable comments but no eslint dependency and no lint script, so they suppressed nothing. The gate found ten real issues (dead initialisers in the alert evaluator, ternaries used as statements, redundant `require()`s in the main process, an unused map index, a rethrow losing its `cause`, three stale directives) — all fixed.
- Tests for logic that had none: the command parser (`parseCommand`/`closestFunctions`/`fuzzyMatch`), the chart range maths (including a guard that pins the v1.0.1 DST fix), and the treemap layout behind `HMAP`. 117 → 171 tests.
- Test and build output is now warning-free (vitest config loaded as ESM, logger no longer imported both ways).

## v1.0.1 — 2026-08-25

Stabilization release — no new features.

### Fixed
- Market countdown could drift ±1h across US DST transitions (wall-clock arithmetic → epoch-exact boundaries; closed-state countdown now targets the actual open).
- Finnhub 403 (plan-gated) was misreported as "key rejected"; all nine provider adapters now share one HTTP-status classifier with documented per-provider quirks (Alpaca 403 = bad key, FRED 400 = bad key, EDGAR 403 = throttle).
- Concurrent identical candle requests could double-spend Twelve Data credits (in-flight coalescing added, matching the screener fix).
- Live-store listener map grew slowly with symbol churn (empty sets now pruned).
- Waking from laptop sleep left a dead WebSocket until the 60 s heartbeat; `powerMonitor` resume now recycles the socket immediately and refreshes visible quotes.
- FMP's 250/day quota reset on every app restart; the bucket now persists across launches.
- Hide-to-tray on Linux desktops without tray support could make the window unreachable (now falls back to a normal close).
- macOS: Windows-style title-bar buttons replaced by native inset traffic lights; every shortcut now accepts Cmd; app menu added. Linux AppImage autostart pointed at the transient mount instead of the AppImage.

### Added (operational, not features)
- Rotating file logging (`userData/logs`, 5×2 MB) with secret redaction; console routed through it.
- Crash capture: main-process errors show a dialog with an "Open logs folder" path; a crashed renderer auto-reloads once.
- Diagnostics export (SET → About): versions, provider status (never keys), bucket states, cache stats, workspace shape, last 200 log lines.
- Store schema versioning + migration runner; corrupt store files are backed up as `<name>.corrupt-<timestamp>.json` and recreated with a user notice.
- SEC EDGAR contact e-mail moved from a code constant to SET → Providers (empty = CACS politely disabled).
- Offline-resilient startup and an offline "save anyway" path in the first-run wizard.
- Test suite grown from 10 to 55 tests (DST matrix, bucket persistence, error classes, router fallback, alert logic, migrations); GitHub Actions CI with a 3-OS installer matrix on tags.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-25

First release. Built in six phases:

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Electron + React + TypeScript (electron-vite), strict main/preload/renderer split: context isolation, sandbox, whitelisted zod-validated IPC, zero third-party requests from the renderer.
- Frameless terminal UI (design tokens, custom title bar, panel grid, command line with autocomplete/history, status bar), first-run API-key wizard with safeStorage encryption, `DES`, `Q/QM`, `SET`, `HELP`.

### Phase 2 — Live market data
- Finnhub WebSocket relay in main: reference-counted subscriptions, 150 ms coalesced tick batches, exponential backoff + jitter reconnect, heartbeat, market-hours idling.
- Provider router (Finnhub → Alpaca fallback; Twelve Data for FX/crypto), token buckets and TTL caches, live ticker tape, `W` watchlists (CSV export), `WEI` world indices, `MOST` movers, live status bar with rate-limit meters, `src/shared/marketHours.ts`.

### Phase 3 — Charting
- `GP`/`GIP` on lightweight-charts: candles/line/area, volume, ranges 1D–MAX, synced RSI/MACD sub-panes, SMA/EMA/Bollinger/VWAP overlays with vitest-tested math, compare mode (% change), live last-candle updates, earnings markers, per-panel persisted settings, priority-queued candle fetches with a disk cache (offline charts).

### Phase 4 — Research
- `N`/`TOP` news (60 s poll, dedupe, Marketaux fallback, session-gated sentiment), `FA` statements/ratios/growth with peers table and Finnhub-metrics fallback mode, `ERN` surprise history, `DVD` dividends, `CACS` SEC EDGAR filings (proper User-Agent, throttle, disk caches), `HP` price table reusing the candle cache.

### Phase 5 — Analysis & tools
- `EQS` screener with saved screens, `PORT` portfolios (live P&L, FX conversion, vs-SPY, JSON import/export), `ALRT` alerts evaluated in main (fire from the tray, REST sweep fallback), `ECO` FRED macro dashboard + release/earnings week, `GC` yield curve, `HMAP` sector treemap, `FX` and `CRYP` dashboards, `MSG` per-ticker notes, tabbed `SET`, registry-driven `HELP`, named workspaces (`WS <name>`).

### Phase 6 — Polish & release
- Pop-out panels (multi-monitor, shared streaming and link groups across windows, geometry saved per workspace with display clamping).
- `OPT` options chain (feature-flagged, Polygon).
- Auto-update plumbing (electron-updater + GitHub Releases; disabled in dev/unsigned builds).
- Universal `ExportService` (CSV with BOM / JSON) across W, HP, EQS, PORT, ALRT, FA, CRYP + workspace export/import.
- Panel snapshots (PNG / clipboard), bundled alert sounds with per-rule selection, auto-launch at login, generated icon set, electron-builder packaging (NSIS / dmg / AppImage+deb), hardening pass.
